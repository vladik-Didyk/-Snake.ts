// Reducers are functions that return a new global state 
// every time an action is dispatched. 

// They take in the current global state and return the new state based 
// on the action that is dispatched/called.  
// This new state is calculated based on the previous state.

// We should be careful here that we do not perform any side-effects inside this function. 
// We should not alter the global state â€“ 
// rather we should return the updated state as a new object itself. 

// Therefore, the reducer function should be a pure function.
