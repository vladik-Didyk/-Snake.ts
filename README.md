<h4 align="center">A simple 2d snake game built using redux and typescript</h4>

## Motivation

This simple game features a snake navigating within a confined space. 
As the snake consumes fruit within the space, it grows in length and the player's score increases. 
However, if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the space, the game ends.

## In this game
 The players control the snake's movement using the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys. 
 The snake's length and the player's score dynamically increase upon consumption of fruit. 
 The game is built using the 'canvas' HTML element.
